# This Is Your Life

Excerpt from the [site this was inspired from](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

*Sometimes life seems really short, and other times it seems impossibly long. But this chart helps to emphasize that it’s most certainly finite. Those are your weeks and they’re all you’ve got. Given that fact, the only appropriate word to describe your weeks is precious. There are **trillions upon trillions** of weeks in eternity, and those are your tiny handful.*

## Background
Pondering the shortness of life is an age-old stoic tradition; we tend to go through life feeling like our time is infinite, so reflecting on this view gives some much-needed perspective.

This Chrome extension auto-creates a simple diagram outlining your life so far - how many weeks have passed, and how many weeks you have left. Although the current life expectancy is typically lower, this calendar counts until you turn **90** (can't hurt to be optimistic).
